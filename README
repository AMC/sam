Simple Academic Manager (SAM)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Summary:
  A simple, easy to use program to facilitate communication between teachers and students including announcements, Assignments, Tests, Grading and Forums.

Why Bother:
  There are a lot of other academic managers on the market including Blackboard, Angel and other open source alternatives. However, none of these programs are intuitive or simple to use. They over complicate simple tasks and provide too many options which overwhelm both teachers and students.

Goal:
  Build a solution observing the KISS principle providing a simple, consistent solution to classroom communication.

Final Product:
  On completion of a release candidate, the program will be tested in live classrooms to determine the direction of further development.

Requests for Information:
  How are students added into the current academic manager? 
  How are classes created? 
  Is any information provided, or is all data inputted manually? 
  If information is provided, is it available in a plain text format? 
  And would that information be available for testing this software?
